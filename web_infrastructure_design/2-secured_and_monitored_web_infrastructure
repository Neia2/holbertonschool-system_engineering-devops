          Monitoring Tools:
          - Logs, QPS metrics, and alerts collected by tools like Prometheus.

Firewalls: Protect servers from unauthorized access and attacks.
HTTPS: Encrypts traffic to prevent eavesdropping and ensure data integrity.
Monitoring:
Tracks performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, traffic volume).
QPS monitoring: Use tools like Prometheus or AWS CloudWatch.
Issues:
SSL Termination: Ending SSL at the load balancer leaves internal traffic unencrypted.
Single MySQL Master: Failure of the Master node disrupts writes.
Uniform Components: Running all services on all servers makes scaling and management harder.
