Load Balancer:
Distributes incoming requests to multiple servers.
Algorithm (e.g., Round-Robin, Least Connections) ensures balanced workloads.
Active-Active: All servers handle traffic simultaneously.
Active-Passive: One server is on standby, taking over during failure.
Database Cluster:
Master Node: Handles all writes.
Replica Node(s): Handle reads and replicate data from the Master.
Issues:

SPOF: Load balancer is a single point of failure without redundancy.
Security: No firewalls or HTTPS.
No Monitoring: System health is not tracked.
